Student: Kassymgali Bakytzhan
Assignment: Interactive Portfolio Website

Objective

The goal of this assignment was to create a fully functional, multi-page portfolio website demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and responsive design principles. The website showcases personal projects, skills, and provides a way for visitors to contact me.

Website Structure

The website contains the following pages:

Home – Introduction and brief overview of myself.

About – Description of skills, technologies (Java, Python, Django), and personal interests.

Projects/Portfolio – Showcases completed projects with images and descriptions.

Contact – Contact form with email link and call-to-action for collaboration.

Key Features

Responsive Design: Website layout adjusts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using Bootstrap grid system.

Interactive Elements: Buttons, hover effects, and links to project details.

Clean and Modern UI: Use of rounded images, shadows, and readable typography.

Navigation Bar: Fixed navbar with smooth scrolling to sections.

Call-to-Action Buttons: Encourages collaboration or project inquiries.

Technologies Used

HTML5 for semantic structure.

CSS3 and Bootstrap 5 for styling and responsive layout.

JavaScript for interactive functionality.

jQuery for DOM manipulation (optional enhancements).

Challenges & Solutions

Large images in the About section: Resolved by using Bootstrap’s img-fluid class and CSS max-height to maintain proper layout.

Responsive navigation: Ensured mobile-friendly navbar using Bootstrap collapse feature.

Maintaining clean repository: Used .gitignore to avoid committing unnecessary local files.

Conclusion

The assignment successfully demonstrates my ability to create a professional portfolio website that is visually appealing, responsive, and interactive. The website can be further enhanced by adding animations, project filters, or a blog section.
